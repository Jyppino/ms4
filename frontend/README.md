# MyShelf Front-End Branch
This branch contains the code from the React Front End.

The Frontend is created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

To communicate with the backend we use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make our api calls.

For testing we use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) in combination with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

## Installation instructions
Requirements:
[npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Make sure you are in the frontend directory: `# cd frontend/`.

`# npm install` (this installs the dependencies)

There is no need to have the backend running locally, since the frontend connects to api.myshelf.nl

## Running

### Starting
`# npm start` (this will start the server on localhost:3000 if 3000 is available)

### Testing
`# npm test` (this will run all tests using jest)
